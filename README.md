 Angular Movie DB app

Description:
Please create Angular application for storing information about movies. For every movie we should be able to save name and year. 
Also, for every movie user can pick one actor from the dropdown.
There should be 2 pages of the application. On the first page there is table which contains all movies (columns: name, year, actor, rate).
By clicking on the movie row, a modal will appear and there the user can add a rating (1-10) to the movie. 
Also just above the table, there is button for adding a new movie and a text input field which can be used for filtering table rows (by actor or movie name). 
The second page contains a form for adding a new movie to our movie DB.

 
 Conditions:
● Use Angular (the newest version) for building the app
● Styling is not that much important, pay attention on TS code quality
● You don’t have to use real services, please use simple angular service to
mock async fetching the data (5 movies and 5 actors/actress)
● Also you don’t have to save new movies somewhere, it’s fine to lose all
newly added movies on refresh.
● For modal (rate movie) and form fields try to use angular material
